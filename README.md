Final Project for 1811 BE Mod-1

Before you submit the project, add a README.md file to your repository that contains a self assessment of your project based on this rubric.

---------------------

FUNCTIONALITY 2

  I have an encrypt/decrypt method, but no CLI.

OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING 1

  Everything is still in 1 class, and nothing is able to work outside of the project at this point--it all requires hard coding, for that matter.

TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT 3

  I jumped the gun a few times on writing code, and then remembered TDD, so scrapped the code and wrote the test and went from there.

VERSION CONTROL 1

  I have 20 commits, and just the 1 pull request.
